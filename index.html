                I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell University, where I am 
                pursuing my dream of becoming a highly skilled software engineer. 
                My journey into the world of computer science has been nothing 
                short of exhilarating, as I immerse myself in a diverse array of 
                subjects within the realm of mathematics and computer science. 
                At the heart of my academic pursuits is a steadfast dedication 
                to mastering the art of software engineering. I firmly believe 
                that this craft is the cornerstone of innovation and progress 
                in our ever-evolving technological landscape. Whether it's 
                designing efficient algorithms, delving into the intricacies 
                of data structures, harnessing the power of natural language 
                processing, or crafting captivating web experiences, I'm 
                constantly pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and skills. 
                Hailing from Kenya, my background has deeply influenced my 
                values and perspectives. One is the belief that technology has 
                the potential to transform lives and drive positive change on a 
                global scale. With this vision in mind, I am not only focused on 
                honing my technical expertise but also on leveraging my abilities 
                to contribute to the growth and development of the tech industry 
                in my home country and continent.

                <p id="sewerTxt" class="hidden">Sewer Navigation - Created a GUI game in Java with a playable character, McDiver, who must collect a ring at the center of a maze. Implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest distance through a maze of underground tunnels to the ring's location. After completing this objective, McDiver used a greedy algorithm to collect as many coins as possible with limited steps before exiting the maze. Ranked among the top ten on the class leaderboard.</p>
                <p id="petTxt" class="hidden">Find-A-Pet - Created an Android app that allows a user to search for pets to adopt based on search parameters such as age, species and location. The app makes a RESTful call to the PetFinder API. The app includes features such as Spinners, RecyclerViews, and Adapters.</p>
                <p id="filtersTxt" class="hidden">Image Filters - Worked with a partner to design a simple program that opens images and edits them. Adopted the use of multidimensional lists to represent pixels in a photo and thereby modify them. Created simple filters and edits such as vignettes, negatives, rotating, and black and white filters. Finally, we incorporated steganography into our program, encoding and decoding words in images.</p>
                <p id="bankTxt" class="hidden">MiniBank - Created a database system in OCaml using Sqlite3. The system is a mini banking system with tellers and customers interacting to deposit, withdraw and transfer funds from account(s). </p>
