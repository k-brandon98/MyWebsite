        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sewer Navigation - Created a GUI game in Java with a playable character,
                McDiver, who must collect a ring at the center of a maze. Implemented Dijkstra's
                Algorithm to find the shortest distance through a maze of underground tunnels
                to the ring's location. After completing this objective, McDiver used a greedy
                algorithm to collect as many coins as possible with limited steps before
                exiting the maze. Ranked among the top ten on the class leaderboard. </li>
            <li>Petfinder - Created an Android app that allows a user to search for pets to
                adopt based on search parameters such as age, species and location. The app
                makes a RESTful call to the PetFinder API. The app includes features such as
                Spinners, RecyclerViews, and Adapters.</li>
            <li>Image Filters - Worked with a partner to design a simple program that opens
                images and edits them. Adopted the use of multidimensional lists to represent
                pixels in a photo and thereby modify them. Created simple filters and edits
                such as vignettes, negatives, rotating, and black and white filters.
                Finally, we incorporated steganography into our program, encoding and decoding
                words in images.</li>
